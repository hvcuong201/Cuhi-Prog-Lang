•	Notes on language:
-	Language is called Cuhi Lang
-	Semantic analyzer was not implemented


•	How to write in this language:
-	Programs start with BEGIN and ends with END.
-	Each statement ends with “;”
-	Each lexeme must be separated by spaces (1 or more)
-	Declare variable before initialize them
-	Math expressions can only be done through assigning variables (assign an expression to a variable to use the result)
-	If is keyword for selection statements, else is for else keyword: if ( Boolean expression)  {execution block } else { execution block} .
-	For  keyword means for loops: for n times { execution block} .
-	All statements in execution block must also end with “.”.
-	There is no limit to number of statements in the execution block.
-	To declare variable: int (name) .
-	To write mathematical expressions: write math expressions like normal but every lexeme must be separated by spaces (syntax analyzer will follow the 6 level precedence described in part B) .
